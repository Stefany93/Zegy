                                                   the hard dark medium brings the drawing a unique feel. Using charcoal

                             The dry brush technique is a very soft way to use a large range of contrast and has similar look 
                             as pencil drawings. This technique can express a very realistic properties of an object, especially 
                             because there are almost no hard edges/outer lining which are easily created with pencil drawings.'

                                                 color strength is the very bright and dark color range and 
                                                 abstract color mix combinations. In addition water brings

                                                 The benefit of using mixed media is using the effects of the different media for the
